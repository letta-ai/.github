[Letta](https://letta.com) adds state to your LLMs to give them advanced reasoning capabilities and transparent long-term memory. You can use Letta to create powerful LLM agents that can reason about their past interactions, learn from them, and improve their behavior over time.

* Download the Letta open source framework on [GitHub](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta)
* Try the [Agent Development Environment (ADE)](https://app.letta.com) to build stateful agents in a no-code UI
* Read the [Letta docs](https://docs.letta.com) to learn about the ADE, Python and TypeScript/Node.js SDKs, Vercel AI SDK integrations and more
* Join our team and other Letta users and developers on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/letta)

Letta is made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by our team in San Francisco ([join us!](https://letta.com#careers)) and over 100 individual contributors from around the world.
